Inheritance :-
Inheritance in OOP allows a new class child to reuse the properties and behaviors of an existing class parent, promoting code reusability and hierarchical organization.

Type of inheritance:-

Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from only one superclass.

Multiple Inheritance: A subclass inherits from more than one superclass.

Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from another subclass, creating a hierarchy.

Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.
